# MEDE-Medicinal-Care-Detector-

MEDE is a wristband that works in conjunction with a smart pill dispenser to accurately track the medications of older people.
The pill dispenser is a smart organizer with discrete compartments illuminated with different LEDs used for storing medicines.
The patient's medical prescription, including tabletâ€™s name, time of ingestion, and expiration date, is fed as an input to the application (App).
All prescription is saved in a cloud database by the application. When it's time for the dose, the app sends a low-frequency vibration to the wrist band, alerting the user to take the pill. At that instance the app sends a trigger, thus illuminating the correct pill compartment for identification to the user.
